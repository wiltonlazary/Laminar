Laminar is a small library that lets you build web application interfaces, keeping UI state in sync with the underlying application state. Its simple yet expressive patterns build on a rock solid foundation of [Airstream](https://github.com/raquo/Airstream) observables and the [Scala.js](https://www.scala-js.org/) platform.

Laminar is also a friendly community of passionate people from across the world who help each other learn new skills and achieve their goals. Check out all the learning materials we've put out, and chat us up on Discord if you hit a snag!
