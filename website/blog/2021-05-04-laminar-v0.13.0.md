Laminar & Airstream are now published directly for Scala 3. This required an internal refactoring of Airstream to satisfy Scala 3's stricter variance checks.

No breaking changes unless you extended / subclassed Airstream observable types.

New tutorial: [Hands-on Laminar](https://blog.softwaremill.com/hands-on-laminar-354ddcc536a9), including form validation and integration with ScalaCSS and Monocle.

New project: [kitlangton/zio-app](https://github.com/kitlangton/zio-app) – Quickly create apps with ZIO and Laminar

Kit published the first alpha of [Animus](https://github.com/kitlangton/animus), an animation library for Laminar.



## Laminar Changes

* Build: Laminar and Airstream are now published directly for Scala 3.0.0-RC3 and RC2 (**update:** and now Scala 3.0.0). The codebase is shared between Scala 2 and Scala 3.

* New: `EventSource`, `SignalSource`, `Source`, and `Sink` type aliases are now available in when importing `com.raquo.laminar.api.L._`



## Airstream Changes

* API: Refactor the class hierarchy to support stricter variance checks in Scala 3 (thanks, [@yurique](https://github.com/yurique)!)

  * **Migration:** If you manually extend Airstream traits `EventStream`, `Signal`, or `Observable`, you should now extend `WritableEventStream`, `WritableSignal`, and `WritableObservable` instead.

  * Other than that, everything should work as before.

* API: Allow third party packages to extend Observable types

  * **Migration:** We changed access modifiers on some members. If you are already extending Airstream observables, read the [new docs section](https://github.com/raquo/Airstream#extending-observables).



## Waypoint Changes

* Build: Upgrade to URL DSL 0.4.0

* New: Base path and fragment matching

  * You can now match routes like `/#/note/123` instead of `/note/123` by providing `basePath = Route.fragmentBasePath` to `Route` constructors. This lets you build a routing frontend without the cooperation of the backend.

  * You can also use hash routing on a `file://` URL now (see e.g. [laminar-examples](https://github.com/raquo/laminar-examples))

* New: Basic route helpers to match URL fragments (text after #)

  * Routes like `(root / "page" / endOfSegments) withFragment` let you capture the whole fragment as one String 

* Fix: When initializing the router, do not update the initial URL to the canonical URL of the initial page

  * Keep the original URL with whatever extraneous query params it might have, to give any third party tools you might be using a chance to look at them

  * **Migration:** If you are relying on previous behaviour, call `router.replaceState(router.$currentPage.now())` on page load (after initializing the router) to accomplish the same in the new version.

* Fix: Respond to `hashChange` events properly
