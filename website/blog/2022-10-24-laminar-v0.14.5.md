## News

Laminar chat has moved from [Gitter](https://gitter.im/Laminar_/Lobby) to [Discord](https://discord.gg/JTrUxhq7sj). We've [considered](https://github.com/raquo/Laminar/discussions/114) several options, and ultimately we're just going where most of the users are. I'm still lurking in Gitter, but most of our community's active members have moved to Discord, so please ask questions there for better visibility.

People sometimes contact me looking for Laminar developers or Laminar jobs, but I am not social enough to be a good matchmaker. I made a `#jobs` channel in the new [Discord server](https://discord.gg/JTrUxhq7sj) – everyone is welcome to post your jobs or advertise your skills for hire, as long as they relate to Laminar.

Antoine's library of [SAP UI5 bindings for Laminar](https://github.com/sherpal/LaminarSAPUI5Bindings) now has a [live demo](https://sherpal.github.io/laminar-ui5-demo/) with all its components, and is published on Maven Central, no need for Jitpack. If you were looking for a robust collection of pre-made web components to use with Laminar, this is it.

Iurii's Laminext Scribble moved to [scribble.ninja](https://scribble.ninja), and supports more UI libraries now.


## Laminar Changes

Laminar v0.14.5 is the same as [v0.14.2](https://laminar.dev/blog/2022/06/23/ecosystem#laminar-releases) but rebuilt with Scala 3.2.0 and Scala.js 1.9.0 to fix Scala.js sourcemap generation in Scala 3.x ([lampepfl/dotty#14240](https://github.com/lampepfl/dotty/issues/14240)). My understanding is that in order to make use of the fix, you need all frontend runtime dependencies to be built with Scala 3.1.3 or higher. All of Laminar's dependencies, as well as Laminext, Frontroute, Waypoint and URL-DSL have been upgraded – use their latest versions.


## What's Next

Last winter I worked a lot on Laminar 15.0.0, but have temporarily shelved everything in March. I have now resumed working on it, expecting an M1 release in a couple months. The work is being done in `next-0.15` branches of Laminar and Airstream repos.

The new version comes not only with a slew of exciting new features, but also with improved behaviour, which necessitated some [breaking changes](https://github.com/raquo/Airstream/issues/93) to Airstream semantics. These changes will require a manual review and retesting of your app, so after M1, Laminar will stay in M-releases for at least a month to give users enough time to report any undesired side effects of the changes. (Of course, a detailed changelog and migration guide will be provided as usual.) Please plan some time for this if you have a big Laminar app.
