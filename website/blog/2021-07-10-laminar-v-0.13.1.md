Caliban GraphQL library has a [Laminar / Laminext intergration](https://ghostdogpr.github.io/caliban/docs/client.html#laminext-integration) now.

Antoine's new blog post: [Cross-Platform Mobile dev with Scala and Capacitor](https://medium.com/geekculture/cross-platform-mobile-dev-with-scala-and-capacitor-54e69b62b50c) shows how you can build mobile apps with Laminar.

Kit's new [Formula](https://github.com/kitlangton/formula) library lets you derive functional, reactive, Laminar forms at compile-time. It's in early stages of development, but already has significant improvements over the implementation that powered the [original video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHriftPO62I).


## Laminar Changes

Laminar v0.13.1 fixes a regression ([#100](https://github.com/raquo/Laminar/issues/100)) introduced in v0.12.2 where invalid user input caused the controlled input element to be reset to an incorrect "last valid value", usually an empty string. "Invalid" in this context means user input that has been filtered out by Laminar/Airstream means, such as a string containing non-digit characters in a zip input like this:

```scala
input(
  controlled(
    value <-- stateVar.signal.map(_.zip),
    onInput.mapToValue.filter(_.forall(Character.isDigit)) --> zipWriter
  )
)
```

Latest Laminar works as expected in this case, resetting the input's value to the correct/expected "last valid value", essentially preventing invalid input.


## Waypoint Changes

Waypoint v0.4.2 fixes a bug caused by apparently inconsistent browser behaviour around `location.origin`. The issue was specific to `file://` URLs in Firefox, so it doesn't affect production. More details [here](https://github.com/raquo/Waypoint#firefox-and-file-urls).

Note: Waypoint v0.4.1 release is the same as v0.4.2 but had a typo in the new error message. You didn't miss anything.
